# HEXA-0POD

@title: 🔁 HEXA-0POD — flame+forge improvement loop on FREE resources only (no vast pod)

@goal: Continuously improve flame + forge using ONLY free resources — the sidecar pool (aiden RTX 5070
sm_120, summer RTX 5070, pi5-akida, ghost) + local CPU/code work. ZERO vast rentals. Each round: pick a
0-pod-feasible improvement, do it, verify on a free pool GPU (byte-eq / bit-exact gates), land it, loop.
Hopper-sm_90a-only work (the wgmma decode-elim own-GEMM) is OUT-OF-SCOPE here (needs an H100 pod); this
loop targets what the consumer card + code can carry.

## milestones (loop self-feeds; add as discovered)

- [ ] **OP-1 — sm_120 own-GEMM speedup on aiden (close the cuBLAS gap, bit-exact)** — the sm_120 OWN120
  (mma.sync m16n8k8 TF32, ~4.9-8.1 TFLOP/s, 3.2-6.9x off cuBLAS) has headroom: deeper smem staging,
  bank-conflict-free loads, register-tiling, mma pipelining (2 mma in flight), vectorized epilogue. Improve
  it toward consumer-card cuBLAS, bit-exact (rel-RMS vs FP64 ref). Free aiden GPU.
- [ ] **OP-2 — wire bench-proven step wins into the REAL flame trainer (forge code + aiden verify)** — the
  HEXA-BENCH wins live only in the bench harness; port the cuBLAS-FP64 lane + fused valley (LN+gelu) +
  single-launch AdamW + transpose-elimination into the actual flame CLMConvMoE trainer step so the real
  product gets faster. Gate: byte-eq vs prior trainer output (max|d|=0) on aiden; the trainer improves, not
  just a benchmark. Pure code + aiden verify, 0-pod.
- [ ] **OP-3 — BF16 sm_120 own-GEMM (aiden)** — extend the sm_120 own-GEMM to BF16 (mma.sync bf16), measure
  vs cuBLAS-BF16, bit-faithful. Free aiden GPU.
- [ ] **OP-4 — flame fused-step on aiden: extend shape/dtype coverage** — run the BENCH-10 fused step across
  more (D,T,B,dtype) on the free 5070, find + document where flame wins/loses on consumer hardware.
- [ ] **OP-5 — forge robustness/correctness hardening (local, 0-GPU)** — pick a forge code-quality / numerical-
  robustness improvement (error paths, dtype edge cases, determinism guards) verifiable without a GPU.

## honest framing (g5)

Free-resource-only loop: every gate runs on the sidecar pool (aiden/summer 5070) or locally — NO vast cost.
Bit-exact / byte-eq discipline holds (the consumer card preserves flame's identity). When a milestone genuinely
needs a Hopper H100 (sm_90a wgmma), it is DEFERRED here (out of 0-pod scope), not faked. The loop drains this
backlog and self-feeds new 0-pod milestones as they surface.
