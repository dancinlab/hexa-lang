# HEXA-0POD

@title: 🔁 HEXA-0POD — flame+forge improvement loop on FREE resources only (no vast pod)

@goal: Continuously improve flame + forge using ONLY free resources — the sidecar pool (aiden RTX 5070
sm_120, summer RTX 5070, pi5-akida, ghost) + local CPU/code work. ZERO vast rentals. Each round: pick a
0-pod-feasible improvement, do it, verify on a free pool GPU (byte-eq / bit-exact gates), land it, loop.
Hopper-sm_90a-only work (the wgmma decode-elim own-GEMM) is OUT-OF-SCOPE here (needs an H100 pod); this
loop targets what the consumer card + code can carry.

## milestones (loop self-feeds; add as discovered)

- [x] **OP-1 — sm_120 own-GEMM speedup on aiden (close the cuBLAS gap, bit-exact)** — the sm_120 OWN120
  (mma.sync m16n8k8 TF32, ~4.9-8.1 TFLOP/s, 3.2-6.9x off cuBLAS) has headroom: deeper smem staging,
  bank-conflict-free loads, register-tiling, mma pipelining (2 mma in flight), vectorized epilogue. Improve
  it toward consumer-card cuBLAS, bit-exact (rel-RMS vs FP64 ref). Free aiden GPU.
  DONE — K2 (bank-conflict-free smem pad + .v4 128-bit global loads + cp.async double-buffer) folded into the
  production owngemm_sm120.cu, bit-exact (rel-RMS vs baseline=0, bitdiff=0). aiden RTX 5070: 6.75->24.49 TFLOP/s
  @1024 (4.16x->1.15x off cuBLAS), 8.05->29.81 TFLOP/s @2048 (3.83x->1.02x off — near parity). cuBLAS-multiple
  3.2-6.9x -> ~1.0-1.15x (target <2.5x beaten). Layout/load-vectorization = dominant lever (+3.1-3.4x); cp.async
  modest top-up; the 128x64 register tile PLATEAUED (regressed on consumer card, not shipped). Verdict
  .verdicts/hexa-0pod/F-OP1-SM120-OWNGEMM.txt.
- [ ] **OP-2 — wire bench-proven step wins into the REAL flame trainer (forge code + aiden verify)** — the
  HEXA-BENCH wins live only in the bench harness; port the cuBLAS-FP64 lane + fused valley (LN+gelu) +
  single-launch AdamW + transpose-elimination into the actual flame CLMConvMoE trainer step so the real
  product gets faster. Gate: byte-eq vs prior trainer output (max|d|=0) on aiden; the trainer improves, not
  just a benchmark. Pure code + aiden verify, 0-pod.
- [ ] **OP-3 — BF16 sm_120 own-GEMM (aiden)** — extend the sm_120 own-GEMM to BF16 (mma.sync bf16), measure
  vs cuBLAS-BF16, bit-faithful. Free aiden GPU.
- [ ] **OP-4 — flame fused-step on aiden: extend shape/dtype coverage** — run the BENCH-10 fused step across
  more (D,T,B,dtype) on the free 5070, find + document where flame wins/loses on consumer hardware.
- [x] **OP-5 — forge robustness/correctness hardening (local, 0-GPU)** — pick a forge code-quality / numerical-
  robustness improvement (error paths, dtype edge cases, determinism guards) verifiable without a GPU.
  DONE — fixed the `self/runtime.h:422-423` `'/*' within block comment` `-Wcomment` warning (the `native/*.c`
  glob inside a `/* … */` block formed a nested `/*` token). Minimal comment-only fix (`native/ *.c`, +2/-2):
  `clang -fsyntax-only -Wcomment -x c self/runtime.h` 2 warnings → 0, no declaration/codegen/behavior change.
  Repo-wide `-Wcomment` + `-Wextra-tokens` sweep over ALL checked-in C/H/CU/CUH + forge-emitted wrappers +
  emit-string `.hexa` sources found NO other genuine hits (one `#pragma once in main file` artifact correctly
  ignored, not "fixed"). All behavior-preserving. Verdict .verdicts/hexa-0pod/F-OP5-FORGE-HARDEN.txt.

## deferred (0-pod follow-ups surfaced by the loop — self-feed)

- **OP-1b — sm_120 own-GEMM: BK=32 + 3-stage cp.async pipeline + .v2/.v4 vectorized epilogue.** OP-1 reached
  1.02-1.15x off cuBLAS with K2 (BK=16, 2-stage). Probe whether deepening the K tile to BK=32 and going to a
  3-deep cp.async ring (wait_group<2>) closes the residual ~3-15% at D=1024 (where K2 is furthest off). Also
  vectorize the C store epilogue (.v2/.v4) — currently 4 scalar masked writes per fragment. Bit-exact gate
  unchanged (accumulation order preserved; pure schedule/layout). Free aiden GPU. The register-tile lever
  (128x64) is CLOSED-NEGATIVE on the consumer card — do NOT re-attempt it; the win is K-pipeline depth + the
  epilogue, not the per-CTA output tile.

- **OP-5b — forge runtime warnings-as-errors CI gate (0-GPU).** OP-5 cleaned the one `-Wcomment` defect in the
  forge/runtime header surface and confirmed (by sweep) it was the only one. Lock it in: add a tiny CI step that
  `clang -fsyntax-only -Wcomment -Werror`-checks the checked-in forge/runtime C/H/CU headers (`self/runtime.h`,
  `self/forge/*.h`, `self/native/*.h`, `self/cuda/*.cu|*.c` wrappers) so a regression can't reland. Pure build-
  level gate, no kernel run — 0-GPU. (Header-standalone `#pragma once`/undefined-CUDA-type artifacts must be
  excluded or the headers compiled via their including TU, not `-x c` standalone.)
- **OP-5c — forge error-path / dtype-edge / determinism hardening (NEEDS GPU — deferred out of 0-GPU scope).**
  The robustness improvements OP-5 originally listed (error paths, dtype edge cases, determinism guards in the
  forge runtime) cannot be gated byte-eq without running a kernel; they belong to a GPU round (aiden 5070), not
  this 0-pod pass. Logged here so the loop doesn't re-attempt them as "0-GPU".

## honest framing (g5)

Free-resource-only loop: every gate runs on the sidecar pool (aiden/summer 5070) or locally — NO vast cost.
Bit-exact / byte-eq discipline holds (the consumer card preserves flame's identity). When a milestone genuinely
needs a Hopper H100 (sm_90a wgmma), it is DEFERRED here (out of 0-pod scope), not faked. The loop drains this
backlog and self-feeds new 0-pod milestones as they surface.
