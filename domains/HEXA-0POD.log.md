# HEXA-0POD — log

## 2026-06-09 — OP-1 DONE: sm_120 own-GEMM 3.2-6.9x -> ~1.0-1.15x off cuBLAS, bit-exact (aiden RTX 5070)

Swept 5 kernel variants (K0 baseline .. K4 all-levers) on aiden (free pool, NO vast). Levers: (1) cp.async
double-buffer, (2) bank-conflict-free smem pad, (3) 128x64 register tile, (5) .v4 128-bit global loads. All
variants BIT-EXACT vs the K0 baseline (rel-RMS=0, bitdiff=0/N) and vs cuBLAS-TF32 (rel-RMS ~3e-5, gate PASS) at
D={1024,2048} — scheduling/layout-only, accumulation order preserved.

Results (TFLOP/s, GPU exclusivity verified): D=1024 K0 6.75 (4.16x off) -> K2 24.49 (1.15x off); D=2048 K0 8.05
(3.83x) -> K2 29.81 (1.02x — near parity). K2 = pad + .v4 + cp.async double-buffer = BEST bit-exact config.
Findings: layout/load-vectorization (K1) was the dominant lever (+3.1-3.4x — baseline had pathological bank
conflicts + scalar loads); cp.async a modest top-up (+0.08-0.15x); the 128x64 register tile (K3/K4) PLATEAUED/
regressed on the consumer card (occupancy loss > AI gain) and was NOT shipped (closed-negative).

Promoted K2 into the production self/native/mma_sm120/owngemm_sm120.cu (gemm_sm120) so flame's real sm_120
own-GEMM gets the speedup — re-verified: GATE @768 rel-RMS 1.33e-5 (== baseline, bit-faithful), PERF 24.48
@1024 / 29.81 @2048 TFLOP/s. Sweep harness owngemm_sm120_opt.cu + build_owngemm_opt.sh kept for reproduction.
Verdict .verdicts/hexa-0pod/F-OP1-SM120-OWNGEMM.txt. Deferred OP-1b (BK=32 / 3-stage pipeline / vectorized
epilogue) appended to self-feed the loop; register-tile lever marked closed-negative (do not re-attempt).

## 2026-06-09 — domain registered (0-pod free-resource improvement loop)

User goal: "0 pod 으로 flame+forge 개선 계속 진행 루프" + "pool 은 활용가능". Continuous flame+forge improvement
using ONLY free resources (sidecar pool aiden/summer RTX 5070 + local code), zero vast rentals. aiden confirmed
free (RTX 5070 sm_120, 0% util). Backlog OP-1..5 (sm_120 own-GEMM speedup · wire bench wins into real trainer ·
BF16 own-GEMM · fused-step coverage · forge hardening). Hopper-only own-GEMM decode-elim is out-of-scope (needs
H100 pod). Loop fans out free-resource agents per round, byte-eq/bit-exact gated on the consumer card.
