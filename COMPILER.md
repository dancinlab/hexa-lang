## 정공법 — drop the C step (orthodox path)

Levers W1, W2, and F all make the *C compilation* faster — but the C
step exists only to hand work to clang, an external compiler. The
orthodox path removes the dependency entirely:

```
current (C-path, depends on clang):
  .hexa --> hexa_v2 --> C --> [ clang -O2 ] --> native binary
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              external dependency · 80% of build wall

정공법 (direct native codegen, self-hosted):
  .hexa --> hexa codegen --> machine code --> native binary
                             (own instr-sel + regalloc + emitter + linker)
```

Why this is the orthodox path, not lever `I` "ranked last":

- It IS hexa-lang's stated architecture — `HEXA-NATIVE-ONLY.md`, `@D g5`
  ("no third-party codegen backend"), `@N n1` ("direct native codegen is
  on the roadmap"; the C path is "fallback, not the architecture").
- clang is the measured 80% of build wall — removing the dependency
  removes the bottleneck at its root, not at the margin.
- "loses clang's optimizer" is not a cost of the path — it is scope
  hexa must own (its own optimizer passes). Keeping clang to borrow its
  optimizer is precisely the external dependency to shed.

The C path stays as the documented portability fallback during the
transition (consistent with `@F f2`: fallback C emission is allowed, it
just is not the architecture).

### Reality check — the 정공법 is ~70% built (2026-05-20 exhaustive survey)

The earlier estimate ("RFC-scale, 10d+, build it from scratch") was
WRONG — a measured falsification. The direct native codegen path
already exists as `compiler/` (85,023 lines of hexa, binary `aprime_cc`):

- Full IR pipeline, built and spec'd (RFC-018): `.hexa` -> lex -> parse
  -> resolve -> check -> lower(HIR) -> lower(MIR, SSA CFG) -> codegen
  (MIR->LIR) -> emit(`.s`). IR structs in `compiler/ir/{hir,mir,lir}.hexa`.
- CPU targets exist: `compiler/codegen/arm64_darwin.hexa` (linear-scan
  regalloc), `x86_64_linux.hexa`, `thumbv7em_eabihf.hexa`.
- It self-compiles: `aprime_cc` byte-cleanly compiles its own hardest
  modules (parser, codegen) to assembly; the frontend typechecks the
  entire 21K-line compiler source with 0 errors.
- Measured corpus: `aprime_cc`-direct passes 30/60 smoke tests vs interp.

What it is NOT yet:

- Not fully self-hosting. The dominant blocker is codegen *performance* —
  `_lower_hexpr` (`compiler/lower/hir_to_mir.hexa`, 1209 lines) is
  super-linear (~0.5 s/stmt); the 21K-line full compiler does not finish
  codegen inside a 9-min cap. This is compiler-engineering, not a
  language gap. Correctness is "almost closed" (residual: nested-struct
  SIGSEGV x3, atlas-verifier divergence x5, macro-depth x3).
- The native path still shells `as` / `clang -c` to assemble the `.s` and
  system `ld` to link. That is the *thin* assembler, not the optimizing
  compiler — the 80%-of-build-wall clang *optimizer* cost is exactly what
  `compiler/`'s own MIR->LIR replaces. An own assembler (drop `as`) +
  `hexa_ld` integration (the in-house linker exists, v1.1) are later
  refinements, not blockers.

So the 정공법 is to FINISH `compiler/`, not to START it.

### 순서 — the ordered sequence

The canonical staged order is already written in `compiler/PLAN.md` #18
("aprime_cc self-host"); that file is the SSOT — this file only
cross-links it:

```
S1  codegen performance — DONE 2026-05-20. The dominant blocker, closed.
    step-1 (commit 8ab732bd): per-phase instrumentation HEXA_CG_PROFILE=1
      + baseline — lower_hir (HIR->MIR) confirmed THE super-linear phase.
    step-2 (commit ce4c9706): hoisted _lower_hexpr's LowerCtx accumulators
      (locals/blocks/bindings) to module scope, killing the per-recursion
      O(N^2) deep-copy of the growing LowerExprResult{ctx}. MEASURED:
      lower_hir at N=400 = 1527 ms -> 9 ms (~170x); O(N^2) -> near-linear.
      byte-eq 7/7 fixtures PASS (perf-only, zero semantic change).
S2  full-closure codegen 완주 — DONE 2026-05-20 (commit a94ed6e3).
    The full 24k-line compiler closure codegens to completion: `.s`
    emits in ~94s (was a 9-min-cap timeout pre-S1). Per-phase:
    lower_hir 971ms (S1 holds at full scale), codegen 7.4s (the new
    long pole, ~79% — not a blocker, <2min total), emit 1.2s. codegen
    diagnostics clean — 0 errors, 0 unmapped-builtins, 11 HX4001 warns.
    S2-followup (non-blocking): codegen sub-phase instrumentation.
S3  self-host fixpoint — PROVEN 2026-05-20. gen1 (built via the hexa_v2
    -> C -> clang path) and gen2 (built by assembling gen1's emitted .s
    of the full closure + a 3-fn shim `gen2_shim.c` mapping native-asm
    builtin names `sha256_hex`/`list_dir`/`mono_ns` to the `hexa_*`
    runtime exports — the asm path lacks build_aprime.sh's sed rewrites)
    both compile the same flatten of `compiler/main.hexa` to BYTE-
    IDENTICAL `.s` — 10,094,662 B, md5
    `29426b801cb072b2861bd608e884b20b`. The compiler reproduces its own
    emitted code: gen3 follows transitively. Honest caveat: the shim is
    a *bootstrap-time naming-convention bridge*, not a semantic gap.
S4  drop the hexa_v2 dependency — wiring DONE 2026-05-20. New
    `tool/build_hexac.hexa` (hexa-native, NOT .sh — hexa-first) runs
    the native path: flatten -> aprime_cc --emit=asm -> 3-fn naming
    shim -> clang assemble+link. Mirrors the gen2 chain verified by
    S3 fixpoint. hexa_v2 is no longer in the compiler's own build
    path. clang remains as assembler+linker only — S7 closes that.
    Verification build deferred to post-rate-limit-reset.

post-fixpoint (beyond compiler/PLAN.md #18 — analysis-side continuation):
S5  native `hexa build` backend — wiring DONE 2026-05-20 (commit
    30dc7a77). HEXA_BACKEND=native selector + resolve_native_cc() added
    to cmd_build, env-gated OFF by default (C path byte-identical when
    unset), smoke-verified — native path builds + runs a trivial program
    (exit 42). Native path is 2-stage (aprime_cc --emit=asm, then clang
    assemble+link runtime.c) because `aprime_cc --emit=exec` does not
    self-link (no runtime.o/crt) — that self-linking is an S7 item.
    Default-on flip waits on S1-S4 (fixpoint) + S7 (native linker).
S6  optimization passes — the basic passes (const_fold, dce, inline)
    are ALREADY wired (`compiler/main.hexa --opt=0..3`). S6 = extend
    them toward parity with clang -O2 via the HEXA-NATIVE-ONLY.md
    G-0..G-11 axis ladder (typed scalar lane A1/A2 first, then loop /
    SIMD / tiling) — that ladder is the substantive gap.
S7  own assembler + hexa_ld — drop `as` / `ld` / `clang`. Design
    contract: RFC 063 (`docs/rfc/rfc_drafts_2026_05_12/rfc_063_s7_
    native_assembler_linker.md`), 4 phases with falsifiers (F-P0-
    OBJEQ / F-P1-RUNEQ / F-P3-ZERO-EXTERN), ~12-18 cycles total.
    P0 scaffold landed 2026-05-20 (`compiler/emit/macho_arm64.hexa`
    — types + entry + encoding checklist + Mach-O constants).
    P1 scaffold landed (`tool/hexa_ld.hexa` — CLI + types + link
    entry + relocation/symbol-resolution checklist). Implementation
    across future S7-{P0,P1,P2,P3} sub-agent cycles. Final closure
    of "의존도 없이 외부 / 완전한 hexa-native".
```

S1 is both the dominant blocker AND a performance problem in its own
right — it is itself an instance of this whole analysis (the compiler
compiling slowly). Start there.

W1/W2/F are now explicitly interim: worth doing only as relief while the
C fallback still exists; they do not substitute for the 정공법.

### Step detail — S2..S7 (prep survey, 2026-05-20)

Surveyed read-only while S1-step-2 runs, so each step is dispatch-ready.

- **S2 — full-closure codegen 완주.** Prereq: S1. Re-run the full
  `compiler/main.hexa` import+use closure (38 files / 21,832 lines)
  through `aprime_cc`; confirm `.s` emits within time (it hit the 9-min
  cap pre-S1). First point full-scope codegen-correctness is measurable.
- **S3 — self-host fixpoint.** Full `.s` -> assemble -> link -> 2nd-gen
  `aprime_cc`. byte-diff 1st-gen (built via hexa_v2) vs 2nd-gen (built
  via aprime_cc) = the fixpoint proof. Harness: `tool/build_aprime.sh`.
- **S4 — drop hexa_v2.** `tool/build_aprime.sh` stage 2 is the hexa_v2
  `.hexa->.c` transpile. Once S3's byte-diff PASSES, swap stage 2 to
  `aprime_cc` — the compiler no longer needs the C transpiler (nor clang)
  to build itself.
- **S5 — native `hexa build` backend.** `compiler/main.hexa` already has
  `--emit=asm|obj|exec` (default exec — it already produces linked
  executables, `:125`/`:151`). `self/main.hexa::cmd_build` (`:1710`)
  currently drives hexa_v2->C->clang. Add a backend selector (env/flag)
  so `cmd_build` can invoke `aprime_cc --emit=exec`. This delivers the
  lever-0 build-speed win to *user* programs, not just the compiler.
- **S6 — optimization passes.** CORRECTION (2026-05-20 prep): the basic
  passes ARE wired, not stubs. `compiler/main.hexa` documents
  `--opt=0..3` (`:128`/`:140-142`): `--opt=1` const_fold, `--opt=2`
  const_fold + dce, `--opt=3` inline_small + const_fold + dce 2-pass.
  `compiler/optimize/{const_fold (160L), dce (152L), inline (412L)}.hexa`
  are implemented (RFC-018 §9). S6 = extend toward parity with `clang
  -O2` via the `HEXA-NATIVE-ONLY.md` G-0..G-11 ladder (typed scalar lane
  A1/A2 first, then loop / SIMD / tiling) — the ladder is the
  substantive gap, not the basic optimizer scaffold.
- **S7 — own assembler + linker (완전한 hexa-native).** `compiler/main.hexa`
  already marks `as` / `ld` / `xcrun` as "L1 keepers — replaced when
  self-as lands" (`:2`, `:806`); an L1->L2 migration scaffold +
  `compiler/intrinsics/intrinsics.hexa` exist. CORRECTION (2026-05-20
  prep): `tool/hexa_link.hexa` is a *clang wrapper* per its own header
  ("Thin clang wrapper. Takes N .c files ... clang handles C-level symbol
  resolution") — NOT a from-scratch linker. S5's finding confirms scope:
  `aprime_cc --emit=exec` does not self-link (no runtime.o / crt). S7 =
  land self-`as` (LIR -> object code directly, skipping `.s` -> `as`) +
  write a real native linker for Mach-O arm64 / ELF x86_64 (relocation
  records + crt + runtime.o). The deepest step — what closes "의존도 없이
  외부" fully.

## Naming — drop the bootstrap vestiges

The bootstrap era left version-suffix / codename file names. As the
정공법 makes `compiler/` the one real compiler, these vestiges go —
completely. The conventions being abandoned:

- version suffixes — `_v2`, `_c2`, any `<n>` generation marker
- codenames — `aprime` (the native compiler's temporary codename)
- stage numbers baked into names — `s4_...`

Vestige inventory (known; canonical names are the plan — adjust before
the rename cycle runs if any name is contested):

| vestige | what it is | canonical |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| `aprime_cc` · `tool/build_aprime.sh` | native codegen compiler + its build | `hexac` · `tool/build_hexac.sh` |
| `hexa_v2` · `self/native/hexa_cc.c` | legacy C transpiler binary + source | `ctrans` · `ctrans.c` |
| `self/codegen_c2.hexa` | C-backend codegen (SSOT) | `codegen_c.hexa` |
| `self/native/codegen_c2_v2.c` | C-frontend codegen mirror | `codegen_c.c` |
| `self/native/{lexer,parser,type_checker}_v2.c` | C-frontend mirror | drop `_v2` |
| `tool/s4_flatc_post.py` | flatten post-processor | `tool/flatc_post.py` |
| `self/native/*.bak.*` · `*.pre*` | dead bootstrap snapshots | delete |

Execution is a SEPARATE atomic cycle — NOT folded into S1. A mass rename
rewrites `import` paths across the whole tree; mixing it into a perf
change makes both unreviewable, and the shared-checkout branch churn
(this session alone saw the branch flip twice) compounds the conflict
risk. Do it in one worktree, atomically, when S1 is parked. New files
created from here on already use clean names — the vestige convention is
abandoned for anything new immediately.

## Pipeline — where the C-path levers sit

```
.hexa source ──▶ hexa_v2 ──▶   C   ──▶  clang  ──▶ native ──▶ run
 (frontend)     transpiler   (1 TU)     (-O?)     binary
     │              │          │          │          │          │
   [H] stream     [F] split  [F] split  [A] -O2   [I] no-C    [D] arena
                  [G] incr. cache       [B] -j [C] cache     [E] clone fix
```

Key observation: the current `flatten` (all modules merged into a single C
translation unit) is the shared root of three problems — out-of-memory,
slow compile, and zero incrementality. That is why `F` is the keystone
*of the C path*: breaking flatten unlocks `B`, `C`, and `G` for free.

## C-path lever matrix — interim relief only

These levers speed the C-transpile path. They are interim: valid only
while the C fallback exists. The 정공법 (lever `I`) supersedes all of them.

| #  | Lever | Axis | Cost | Gain (estimate) | Lossless? |
|----|-------|------|------|-----------------|-----------|
| 0  | Compile profiling / instrumentation | diagnostic | 0.5d | fixes the ranking of the other 9 | yes |
| A  | ~~`clang -O2` on emitted C~~ — ALREADY SHIPPED (`self/main.hexa:1910` `cmd_build`; runtime `:913/915`). No work left. | runtime speed | done | — | — |
| B  | per-module `.c` -> `clang -j` parallel | compile speed | 1d* | compile wall / N cores | yes |
| C  | content-hash C/.o cache (ccache-style) — measured: caching `runtime.o` alone removes 53% of build wall, see W1 | compile speed | 1-2d* | skip recompile of unchanged modules | yes |
| A2 | `-O0`/`-O1` fast-dev build flag (current build is `-O2`-always) | compile speed | 0.5d | app.c clang 3.6s -> 0.7s (5x), see W2 | yes (flag-gated) |
| D  | `HEXA_VAL_ARENA` reclaim wiring | resource | 1-2d | lower memory peak on long compiles | env opt-in |
| E  | `struct_pack_map` shallow-clone gotcha fix | correctness + resource | 1d | removes bug + avoids needless clones | yes |
| F  | drop flatten -> separate compilation (C-path keystone) | all 3 axes | 4-7d | resolves OOM + unlocks B/C/G | yes |
| G  | module-level incremental compile (on top of F) | compile speed | in F | 1-line edit: full build -> 1 module | yes |
| H  | streaming codegen (no whole-AST in memory) | resource | 5-8d | large drop in compile memory peak | yes |
| **I** | **정공법 — finish `compiler/`: hexa-lang's own native codegen (binary `aprime_cc`). Replaces the clang stage outright — see "정공법" section.** | all axes | finish (~70% built) | removes clang = removes 80% of build wall at the root | yes (self-hosted) |

`*` B and C depend on `F` (split) — neither parallelism nor caching is
possible while the build is a single flattened translation unit.

## Recommended order

**Wave 1 — cheap, lossless (~3d):** `0` profile -> `E` clone fix. Lever
`A` (`-O2`) was found already shipped; the `0` profile decides whether
`D` or `H` is the higher-priority memory lever.

**Wave 2 — C-path keystone (`F` separate compilation, ~1 week):** breaking
flatten makes `B`, `C`, and `G` follow for free. The OOM wall (full
`compiler/main.hexa` flatten exceeds memory on every host) is resolved
structurally here.

**Wave 3 — the 정공법 (`I`, finish `compiler/` native codegen):** the
orthodox fix — replace the clang stage with hexa-lang's own MIR->LIR
native codegen. `compiler/` already exists (85K LoC, binary `aprime_cc`)
and nearly self-hosts; the work is to FINISH it, not start it. Ordered
sequence S1->S7 is in the "순서" section above. W1/W2/F (Waves 1-2) are
interim relief on the C path, not substitutes for it.

## Why lever 0 leads

Every gain figure above is an *estimate*. Running `0` (cost ~= free, it is
a diagnostic, not a cost-bearing fire) turns the ranking into measurement:
if clang dominates compile wall, `B` wins; if the `hexa_v2` frontend
dominates, `H` wins. A half-day profile validates or refutes the 1-week
bet on `F` before it is made.

---

## Lever 0 — measured profile (2026-05-20)

Target: `hexa build self/main.hexa` — the hexa CLI itself (183 KB source
-> 155 KB / 3331-line C). Profiled on the local macOS host with
`/usr/bin/time -l`.

| Stage | Wall | Peak RSS | Share |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| 1+2  flatten + transpile (`hexa_v2`) | 2.4s | 103 MB | ~21% |
| 3    clang `-O2`  — `runtime.c` (9574 lines) | 6.2s | 164 MB | ~53% |
| 3    clang `-O2`  — `app.c` (transpiled program) | 3.6s | 120 MB | ~31% |
| **total** (one-shot link 9.3s + transpile 2.4s) | **~11.7s** | 163 MB | 100% |

Reference: `app.c` at `-O0` compiles in 0.70s vs 3.57s at `-O2` — a 5x
optimizer tax.

### Findings

1. **clang is 80% of build wall** (9.3s / 11.7s). The transpiler is cheap.
   So `H` (streaming the transpiler) has only a small ceiling — but `I`
   (native codegen) does not: it replaces the clang stage outright. That
   is why `I`, not `H`, is the 정공법.
2. **`runtime.c` recompile = 53% of every build** (6.2s). The same
   unchanged 9574-line C file is recompiled at `-O2` on every build
   (one-shot link, `self/main.hexa:1910`). It is larger than the
   transpiled program itself.
3. **`-O2` costs 5x** vs `-O0` on the transpiled C. The build is
   `-O2`-always — the wrong default for the edit-compile-test loop.
4. **No OOM on this target** (peak 163 MB). The known OOM is specific to
   `compiler/main.hexa`, whose flatten merges all imported stdlib into one
   translation unit — a result already settled (see
   `project_compiler_selfbuild_blockers`), not re-fired here. Lever `F`
   stays the C-path keystone for *that* import-heavy / OOM target class
   only; monolithic builds like `self/main.hexa` do not need it.

### Re-ranked C-path quick wins (measured, supersede pre-profile estimates)

- **W1 — cache `runtime.o`**: build it once at `-O2`, link the cached
  object. 6.2s -> ~0s amortized. Build wall 11.7s -> ~5.5s (~2x). Cost
  ~0.5d. Lossless (the runtime TU does not change between app builds).
- **W2 — `-O0`/`-O1` fast-dev flag**: `app.c` 3.6s -> 0.7s. Stacked on
  W1: 11.7s -> ~3.1s (~3.8x faster dev loop). Release builds keep `-O2`.
  Cost ~0.5d.
- `F` (flatten split) remains the C-path keystone but is now scoped: it
  earns its cost on import-heavy / OOM targets, not on the common build.

These are interim — they speed the C path that the 정공법 (lever `I`)
ultimately removes.

## Log

- 2026-05-20 — initial brainstorm captured (10 levers, 3 waves).
- 2026-05-20 — lever `0` (profiling) DONE — see "Lever 0 — measured
  profile" above. clang is 80% of build wall; `runtime.c` recompile
  alone is 53%. Re-ranked: W1 (`runtime.o` cache, ~2x) + W2 (`-O0` dev
  flag, stacked ~3.8x) are the measured top quick wins; lever `A`
  (`-O2`) was found already shipped.
- 2026-05-20 — 정공법 recorded. The orthodox path is not optimizing the
  C path — it is removing it: clang is an external dependency and the
  measured 80% of build wall. Lever `I` promoted to keystone; W1/W2/F
  demoted to interim C-path relief.
- 2026-05-20 — exhaustive survey: the 정공법 is ~70% built. The native
  codegen already exists as `compiler/` (85K LoC, binary `aprime_cc`)
  with a full HIR/MIR/LIR pipeline that self-compiles its hardest
  modules. No new RFC needed — the staged sequence is `compiler/PLAN.md`
  #18 (S1->S4). The earlier "RFC-scale, build from scratch" estimate was
  falsified.
- 2026-05-20 — renamed `ROI.md` -> `COMPILER.md`; the doc is now a
  compiler build-speed + native-codegen analysis, not a generic ROI
  brainstorm.
- 2026-05-20 — naming policy recorded (user directive "v2 이런것도 안됨,
  전부 깔끔하게"). Bootstrap vestiges (`_v2` / `_c2` / `aprime` / `s4`
  stage-numbers) are abandoned: new files use clean names immediately;
  existing vestige files are renamed in a separate atomic worktree cycle
  (see "Naming — drop the bootstrap vestiges"). Not folded into S1.
- 2026-05-20 — S1-step-1 DONE (commit `60946b8d`). Per-phase codegen
  instrumentation landed (`HEXA_CG_PROFILE=1`, zero behavior change when
  off). Baseline on the `fn big()` N-stmt probe: `lower_hir` (HIR->MIR)
  is THE super-linear phase — 15/63/372 ms at N=100/200/400 (~5.9x per
  N-doubling = O(N^2)+); `codegen` (6/10/29) and `emit` (1/1/4) are
  near-linear. Root cause = `_lower_hexpr` returning `LowerExprResult{
  ctx: LowerCtx}` -> deep-heapify of the growing `LowerCtx.blocks`.
  S1-step-2 = hoist those accumulators to module scope.
- 2026-05-20 — work moved to a dedicated worktree branch
  `compiler-native-codegen`. The shared main checkout branch-flipped 4x
  in one session, scattering commits; this doc + its follow-on now live
  on one stable branch.
- 2026-05-20 — S2..S7 prep survey done (read-only, in parallel with the
  S1-step-2 sub-agent). Each step now has a dispatch-ready sub-plan with
  file references — see "Step detail — S2..S7". Key finding: S7 (own
  assembler) is already scaffolded — `compiler/main.hexa` marks `as`/`ld`
  as "L1 keepers, replaced when self-as lands"; S5 is small (the native
  compiler already does `--emit=exec`, only `cmd_build` wiring is missing).
- 2026-05-20 — **S1 DONE.** step-2 (campaign-branch commit `ce4c9706`)
  hoisted `_lower_hexpr`'s `LowerCtx` accumulators to module scope,
  killing the O(N²) deep-copy. Measured: `lower_hir` at N=400 went
  1527 ms -> 9 ms (~170x); the super-linear curve is gone. byte-eq 7/7
  fixtures PASS — verified correctness-preserving. The dominant self-host
  blocker is closed. Next: S2 (full-closure codegen 완주).
- 2026-05-20 — **S2 PASS** (campaign-branch commit `a94ed6e3`). The full
  `compiler/main.hexa` closure (24k lines) codegens to completion through
  `aprime_cc` in ~94s — pre-S1 it timed out at the 9-min cap. `.s` =
  10 MB / 252k lines, 14,067 fn labels, well-formed; codegen diagnostics
  clean (0 errors). S1's fix confirmed effective at full scale
  (lower_hir 971ms). New long pole = codegen MIR->LIR (7.4s, ~79%) but
  not a blocker. Next: S3 (assemble + link self-host fixpoint).
- 2026-05-20 — **S5 wiring DONE** (campaign-branch commit `30dc7a77`,
  done in parallel with S3). `cmd_build` gained a `HEXA_BACKEND=native`
  selector + `resolve_native_cc()` — purely additive, env-gated off, C
  path byte-identical when unset; smoke-verified native build of a
  trivial program. Finding that feeds S7: `aprime_cc --emit=exec` does
  not self-link, so the native path still delegates assemble+link to
  clang — confirming the native-linker work S7 must do.
- 2026-05-20 — **S3 dispatch hit a rate-limit** (Anthropic account quota,
  reset ~07:50 KST). The sub-agent's worktree cherry-picked S1 prereq
  successfully but never reached the fixpoint measurement; no S3 commit
  landed. Will re-dispatch after the reset.
- 2026-05-20 — deeper S6/S7 prep done read-only (rate-limit-safe).
  Corrections: S6's basic passes (const_fold/dce/inline) are ALREADY
  wired into `--opt=0..3`, not stubs — S6's real gap is the HEXA-NATIVE-
  ONLY G-ladder. S7's `tool/hexa_link.hexa` is a clang wrapper per its
  own header, NOT a from-scratch linker — S7 needs a new native object-
  file linker.
- 2026-05-20 — **🛸 S3 PROVEN — SELF-HOST FIXPOINT.** The rate-limited
  S3 sub-agent's `/tmp` artifacts survived; running the byte-diff that
  the agent could not complete shows gen1's and gen2's emitted `.s` of
  the full `compiler/main.hexa` closure are **byte-identical** —
  10,094,662 B, md5 `29426b801cb072b2861bd608e884b20b`. gen1 = built via
  `hexa_v2` -> C -> clang; gen2 = assembled from gen1's `.s` + a 3-fn
  shim (`gen2_shim.c`, asm-path naming bridge for `sha256_hex` /
  `list_dir` / `mono_ns`). The compiler reproduces its own emitted code.
  hexa-lang's stated north-star "②인터프리터 폐기·self-host" reaches its
  first measured proof point. Campaign branch state: S1 ✅ + S2 ✅ + S5
  ✅ (wiring) + S3 ✅. Next: S4 (drop hexa_v2 from build_aprime.sh
  stage 2 — now concretely doable).
- 2026-05-20 — **S4 wiring DONE.** New `tool/build_hexac.hexa` (hexa-
  native build orchestrator — NOT a `.sh`, honoring hexa-first per a
  PreToolUse warn). Encodes the gen2 recipe verified by S3: flatten ->
  `aprime_cc --emit=asm` -> 3-fn naming shim -> clang assemble+link ->
  Mach-O verify. The compiler's own build no longer goes through
  hexa_v2. parse-gate PASS. Verification build (actual run +
  byte-diff vs `tool/build_aprime.sh` output) deferred to post-rate-
  limit-reset. clang remains as assembler+linker at stage 4 — that is
  the LAST external toolchain dependency for the compiler's own build,
  scheduled for elimination by S7 (own assembler + `hexa_ld`).
- 2026-05-20 — **S7 RFC 063 DRAFTED.** `docs/rfc/rfc_drafts_2026_05_12/
  rfc_063_s7_native_assembler_linker.md` — 4-phase design (P0 Mach-O
  arm64 object emitter `compiler/emit/macho_arm64.hexa` / P1 native
  Mach-O linker `tool/hexa_ld.hexa` / P2 ELF x86_64 / P3 flip
  default), each with a falsifier. Total estimate ~12-18 cycles —
  the campaign goal "완전한 hexa-native" is multi-week, this session
  lands the design contract + S1-S5 wiring. Honest scope: RFC drafted
  + scaffold plan, not implementation. Implementation across future
  S7-{P0,P1,P2,P3} sub-agent cycles.
- 2026-05-20 — **S7 P0 + P1 scaffolds LANDED.** Two new hexa-native
  files, parse-gate PASS, NOT yet imported into `compiler/main.hexa`
  (free-standing scaffolds awaiting their implementation sub-agents):
  - `compiler/emit/macho_arm64.hexa` — P0 LIR -> Mach-O arm64 `.o`
    emitter. Mach-O constants + relocation types + `MachoArm64Obj`
    / `Arm64Reloc` / `MachoSymbol` structs + entry stubs +
    encoding-table checklist + cross-references to
    `compiler/codegen/arm64_darwin.hexa` and `compiler/emit/asm
    .hexa` (the .s emitter to mirror).
  - `tool/hexa_ld.hexa` — P1 native Mach-O linker. CLI arg parser
    + `ParsedObj` / `LinkSym` / `ParsedReloc` structs + link entry
    stub + symbol-resolution + relocation-fix-up checklists.
    Explicitly NOT a rename of `tool/hexa_link.hexa` (which stays
    as the C-path clang wrapper until S7 P3 retires it).
  Future P0/P1 sub-agents fill the encoding tables + Mach-O
  serialization in these scaffolds, then run the F-P0-OBJEQ /
  F-P1-RUNEQ corpora.
