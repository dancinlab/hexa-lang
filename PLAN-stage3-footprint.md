## Problem (measured)

`compiler/main.hexa` self-compiles a 25,932-line flat-spliced super-module.
The back half of the pipeline materialises **four whole-program carriers**
that are all resident simultaneously at peak:

```
parse → Module(AST) ─lower─→ HModule ─lower_hir─→ MModule ─codegen─→ LModule ─emit─→ asm_text
```

`doc/stage0_arena_phases.md` §"hand-off audit" already proved each carrier
is **dead** once the next phase consumes it (AST after `lower`, HModule
after `lower_hir`, …). But nothing frees them: the Val arena
(`HEXA_VAL_ARENA`) reclaims only *scoped transient* allocations, not these
persistent heap carriers. Confirmed empirically — an `HEXA_VAL_ARENA=1`
self-compile still blows a 4.5 GB cap (interp-host probe, 2026-05-16);
the arena is not the lever.

The envelope fix `f4b597a7` (heapify TAG_STR O(blocks)→O(1)) is a landed
**prerequisite** — it makes a per-iteration arena heapify cheap — but on
its own changes only compile *time*, not RSS.

## Tactic — fuse the four per-function loops into one

All four back-half passes already have a per-item/per-function main loop:

| pass | file | per-item call |
|------|------|---------------|
| `lower`     | `compiler/lower/ast_to_hir.hexa:2070` | `_lower_item(it, def, atlas, module_sc)` → `HItem` |
| `lower_hir` | `compiler/lower/hir_to_mir.hexa:1637` | `_lower_fn(it)` → `MFunc` |
| `codegen`   | `compiler/codegen/arm64_darwin.hexa:1588` | `_arm64_lower_func(mf, st, modhash)` → `LFunc` |
| `emit`      | `compiler/emit/asm.hexa:357` | `_emit_func(target, f)` → `string` |

Today they run as four sequential whole-module loops, each retaining its
full output array. **Streaming** interleaves them into a single loop so
only one function's HIR/MIR/LIR is live at a time:

```
# after lower()'s DefId/scope pre-pass (whole-program — unavoidable):
for each item in module.items:
    arena_scope_push()                       # rt 32-L Val-arena frame
    hitem = _lower_item(it, def, atlas, module_sc)
    if hitem is fn:
        mfunc = _lower_fn(hitem)
        st    = _collect_strs_from_fn(st, mfunc)   # strtab grows incrementally
        lfunc = _arm64_lower_func(mfunc, st, modhash)
        asm_text += _emit_func(target, lfunc)      # the ONLY escaping value
    arena_scope_heapify(asm_text); arena_scope_pop()  # frees hitem/mfunc/lfunc
```

Peak resident drops from `AST + HModule + MModule + LModule` to
`AST + module_sc + one item's HIR/MIR/LIR + asm_text + strtab`. The Val
arena scope pop is what actually reclaims each function — and the `f4b597a7`
envelope fix keeps the per-iteration heapify of the escaping `asm_text`
fragment O(1).

## Caveats (each must be handled in the refactor)

1. **strtab** — `_build_arm_strtab` currently pre-walks the whole MModule.
   Make it incremental: intern each `MFunc`'s string literals into the
   running `ArmStrTab` inside the fused loop, *before* `_arm64_lower_func`
   (which needs `st` for operand resolution). Label assignment is
   insertion-ordered, so incremental interning is byte-deterministic.
   `rodata` is finalised by `_strtab_to_rodata(st)` after the loop.
2. **globals** (`ITEM_LET`) — `lower_hir` collects these into `MModule.globals`.
   Keep a lightweight pre-pass (or accumulate during the fused loop) — they
   are small; no streaming needed.
3. **rodata / bss** — accumulated, emitted after the `.text` loop (matches
   `emit_asm`'s existing structure: `.text` loop then `.rodata`).
4. **front half stays whole-program** — `lex/parse/resolve/bind/types` and
   `lower`'s DefId pre-pass need the whole AST/scope. The AST is therefore
   resident for the whole streaming loop. Streaming reclaims the HIR/MIR/LIR
   layers only; the durable AST cost is bounded and acceptable.
5. **diagnostics** — `_lower_item` / `_lower_fn` emit diags into module-level
   buffers; draining order is unchanged (drain after the loop).

## Phased steps

- **F1** — make `_build_arm_strtab` incremental: expose
  `_arm_strtab_collect_fn(st, mf) -> ArmStrTab`; keep the whole-module
  wrapper for the non-streaming path. Verify: existing codegen byte-identical.
- **F2** — add `codegen_emit_streaming(hmodule, atlas, target) -> string` in
  a new `compiler/codegen/stream.hexa` that runs the fused loop. The legacy
  `lower_hir → codegen → emit_asm` path stays for `--emit obj`/debug.
- **F3** — `compiler/main.hexa`: when `emit_kind == "asm"`, call the streaming
  path; gate behind `--stream` (or `HEXA_STREAM=1`) until byte-diff-verified.
- **F4** — ~~wire the Val-arena scope push/pop around the loop body~~
  **superseded — see "Finding" below.** A loop-body arena scope reclaims
  only per-iteration *string scratch*; it cannot free the per-function
  MFunc/LFunc, which are fn return values heapified to the malloc heap by
  `__hexa_fn_arena_return` (runtime.c). Re-scoped F4 = incremental asm
  output (kill the O(n²) `out = out + frag` accumulator — see Finding §2).
- **F5** — make streaming the default once verified; retire the `--stream` gate.

## Finding (2026-05-16): streaming structure ≠ native reclaim

Tracing `__hexa_fn_arena_return` / `hexa_val_heapify` in `self/runtime.c`:

1. **Per-function IR is not reclaimed by streaming alone.** Every sub-call
   in the fused loop (`_lower_fn`, `_arm64_lower_func`, `_emit_func`)
   returns a value; `__hexa_fn_arena_return` **heapifies the return to the
   malloc heap** and pops that call's arena frame. hexa-native has no
   `free` / GC, so the MFunc/LFunc — though logically dead after the
   iteration — persist on the malloc heap. Wrapping the loop body in an
   arena scope (the old F4) does **not** help: the structs already escaped
   to malloc, which an arena pop cannot reclaim. Streaming bounds the
   *logical* live set but not native RSS without a reclaim mechanism:
   either region-promote-to-parent-frame (heapify into the enclosing
   arena instead of malloc) or explicit struct free — both architectural.

2. **The asm accumulator is a separate O(n²) sink — in BOTH paths.**
   `out = out + _emit_func(...)` (here *and* in the legacy `emit_asm`)
   re-copies the whole `out` string every function. For an N-function
   compile producing a T-byte `.s` that is O(N·T) transient bytes —
   gigabytes for the self-compile. This is target-independent, not
   streaming-specific, and is the largest *cheaply* fixable sink.

Re-scoped plan: **F4 = incremental asm output** — `codegen_emit_streaming`
writes each function's fragment to the output file as it is produced
(append) instead of growing `out`; the legacy `emit_asm` gets the same
treatment. Removes the O(n²) accumulator from both paths. The per-function
IR reclaim (Finding §1) is tracked separately as **F6 (architectural)** —
region-based promotion or a struct freelist — and is the genuine
remaining footprint lever; it is not loop-tick-sized.

## Verification (the only honest signal)

Streaming must be a **pure refactor** — same `.s` bytes, less RSS:

1. `emit asm` with and without `--stream` → **byte-identical** `.s`
   (run on `compiler/main.hexa` itself + a sweep of `test/*.hexa`).
2. peak-RSS delta: `__HEXA_ARENA_RSS_MB__` probe at the fused loop's tail
   vs the legacy path — target **< 4 GB** for the stage-1 self-compile
   (down from 10–16 GB), making the verdict runnable without special hosts.
3. Then the stage-3 verdict per `PLAN-stage3-pathA.md` S4: stage-1 →
   stage-2 → byte-diff. Streaming is what unblocks running it at all.

## Status

- ✅ prerequisite `f4b597a7` — heapify TAG_STR O(1) envelope (landed, verified
  15× on the O(n²); byte-identical output).
- ✅ F1 `f39a3bd9` — `_arm_strtab_collect_fn` extracted (per-MFunc interning).
- ✅ F2 `2002c023` — `codegen_emit_streaming` (fused per-fn loop).
- ✅ F3 `8a40b521` — `--stream` / `HEXA_STREAM=1` gate in `compiler/main.hexa`.
- 🔄 F4 — **re-scoped** (see Finding): incremental asm output, kills the
  O(n²) accumulator in both `codegen_emit_streaming` and `emit_asm`. Needs
  hexa's file-append API checked first. Loop-tick-sized, host-RAM-independent.
- ⬜ F5 — streaming default once F4 + byte-diff verified.
- ⬜ F6 (architectural) — per-function IR reclaim (region-promote-to-parent
  or struct freelist). The genuine native-RSS lever per Finding §1; not
  loop-tick-sized — needs a design-gate.
